            Our mobile and web based software solutions are custom designed for each client. 
            Each project starts with a customer description of the problem they are trying to solve.
            They have multiple employees who hand gather data at a variety of offsite locations. At 
            the end of the day, it’s turned in for someone to manually enter into their proprietary 
            computer system.
          </p>
          <h3>They had four problems to solve:</h3>
          <ul class='lead'>
            <li>Easy to use interface</li>
            <li>Instant access to information</li>
            <li>Better accuracy and efficiency</li>
            <li>Minimize internal software changes</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>We recommended a 3-Tier approach:</h3>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li>Mobile Survey Application with separate designs optimized for the iPhone and iPad.</li>
            <li>A cloud based Ruby on Rails server to handle syncing questions and answers with JSON.</li>
            <li>A thin layer internal interface to translate the questions and answers to and from their existing format.</li>
          </ul>
